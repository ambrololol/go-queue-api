## Queue-API
This project is created for training purposes, demonstrating a queue system built with Go.

## Features
- **Framework**: Uses [Gin Gonic](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) to handle API routing and HTTP requests.
- **Go Concepts**: Implements core Go programming concepts, focusing on clean and efficient code structure.
- **Concurrency with Goroutines and Channels**: Demonstrates how to use goroutines and channels to manage a queue system asynchronously, improving efficiency and responsiveness.

## What Youâ€™ll Learn
- Setting up and using Gin Gonic for RESTful API development in Go.
- Applying goroutines to handle concurrent tasks, ensuring the queue operates smoothly even under load.
- Using channels for safe communication between goroutines in a queue system.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
